            <h1>Gzip Explorer — Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>Last updated: December 05, 2025</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This privacy page describes the data practices for the mobile
                application <strong>Gzip Explorer</strong> and the companion static
                website. <strong>Gzip Explorer</strong> is a lightweight, privacy-first
                mobile app whose only runtime behavior is to extract `.zip` project
                archives and display their files in a code editor viewer. The app
                does not collect, store, or transmit personal data beyond what is
                required to perform these actions on-device.
            </p>

            <h2>What Gzip Explorer Does NOT Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No personal identifiers (names, emails, phone numbers).</li>
                <li>
                    No behavioral analytics, page-view tracking, or heatmaps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No cookies or local storage used for tracking for analytics.
                </li>
                <li>No user accounts, authentication, or profile storage.</li>
                <li>No forms that transmit user-provided data to servers.</li>
                <li>
                    Files extracted from `.zip` archives are processed locally
                    on the device and are not uploaded by the app.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Minimizing data collection reduces risk and simplifies
                compliance. The site purposefully avoids adding any code (client
                or server) that would capture user data.
            </p>

            <h2>Ads and Third-Party Resources</h2>
            <p>
                The mobile app may display ads in places selected by the app
                developer. These are non-targeted ads intended to support
                development and are not used to build profiles or target users.
                The companion website uses only build-time dependencies (see
                `package.json`) and does not run analytics or tracking scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                If any future contributor adds a third-party script or ad SDK,
                it must be approved and explicitly documented on this page.
            </p>

            <h2>Security & Code Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    No server-side endpoints exist that accept or store POSTed
                    user data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All app file processing (unzipping and file rendering)
                    happens on-device; the app does not transmit file contents
                    to remote servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid introducing SSR endpoints or any networked data
                    collection without review and explicit documentation on this
                    page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Follow secure coding practices when editing code: validate
                    inputs where applicable and avoid eval-like patterns.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                If the site ever changes to collect data, this page will be
                updated and the change will be explicitly documented here.
            </p>
